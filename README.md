# 👋 Hello world

I decided to create this app mainly for fun and to experiment with time API (http://worldtimeapi.org/). This counter is calculating the amount of time which has passed since release of season 1,2 or 3 of Kipo and the age of Wonderbeasts series.

This is absolutely pointless website I'm aware of that but it was fun to make for sure :)

## 📜 Libraries and other things I've used

- [Vue.js]
- [Axios]
- [Vuex]
- [vue-toaster]
- [TailwindCSS]
- [Docker] & [Docker-compose] (deployment)
- Html, CSS and JS (of course)

## 🖥️ Running dev environment process

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
$ npm run serve

```

## 🌎 Deployment

I've deployed this app with 🐬 Docker [live version]
